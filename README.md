The files in this section were created by Kritika Saxena for the lecture on Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) as part of the Impact Evaluation Summer School organized by Core-IPD in Ghana in 2025.
The PDF file is the main lecture slides.
Rest of the files follow a simulated data to practice RDD estimation.
